\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-This \-Documentation}
\-Is the same style as the \-Java\-Doc documentation. \-The same commands are used in the code, and generates these pages. \-For info on the program used check out a program called \-Doxygen.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
\-Check the \-Doxygen site for info about the syntac used, but basically when you are writing the source code, you put certain patterns in the comments which doxygen can pick up later. \-It also scans through and figures out how all the functions are connected together.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
\-You can use this documentation page to view all of the programs source code and figure out which function calls what. \-Much of the source code's original comments have been set to show up here, though clearer commenting is definitely necessary.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
